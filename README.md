# cbioportal-core
Many of the Java classes here are in use by the main [cbioportal/cbioportal codebase](https://github.com/cbioPortal/cbioportal), the `metaImport.py` Python scripts are all used for importing. We decided to move them all to a single repo so that we might deprecate them in the future once we have come up with a good plan for replacing them.

This repo contains:

- many old Java classes for interacting with the database
- The `metaImport.py` Python script used for importing

## Inclusion in main codebase
The `cbioportal-core` code is currently included in the final Docker image during the Docker build process: https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/blob/master/docker/web-and-data/Dockerfile#L48
